## What is Towers?

Towers is a thrilling game of skill, risk, and rewards, offering players the chance to win big by climbing a tower and avoiding hidden bombs. Here's how it works:

1. **Pick Your Difficulty** - Choose from four levels—Easy, Medium, Hard, or Nightmare. Higher levels bring greater multipliers but also higher risks.
2. **Climb to Win** - Each level challenges you to pick the correct safe spot to progress upward. The more you climb, the bigger your multiplier grows.
3. **Avoid the Bombs** - Hitting a bomb ends the game and forfeits your winnings.
